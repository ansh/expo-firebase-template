# Basic Firebase + Expo + React Navigation v5 setup

This is a starter project meant to be used to initialize basic projects that are made using Firebase, Expo, and React Navigation. It has basic auth done along with a bottom tab navigation to quickly initialize projects using this stack. I recommend using this stack to create cross-platform mobile apps to quickly test and validate an idea! This setup is not meant to scale. It is optimized for small-medium sized apps that are used to create MVP versions of a product.

## Features

- Expo v41 setup
- Firebase authentication with username/password using Context API
- React Navigation v5 setup
- Bottom tab layout configured


## Setup guide

1. Add Firebase config in `src/config/firebase.js`
2. Add app name and details in `app.json`
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
4. Run `yarn start` to start the project!
